Hereâ€™s a sample `README.md` file for your weather service project:

# Weather Service

A simple Express.js application that fetches and displays weather information based on user input or current location using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Features

- Get weather information for a specified city.
- Fetch weather data based on the user's current location.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14.x or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd weather-service
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenWeatherMap API key:

   ```
   WEATHER_API_KEY=d885aa1d783fd13a55050afeef620fcb
   ```

### Running the Application

Start the server with:

```bash
node server.js
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default. 

### API Endpoints

1. **Fetch Weather by City Name**

   - **Endpoint:** `GET /weather?city=<city>`
   - **Query Parameters:**
     - `city`: The name of the city to get the weather for.
   - **Example Request:**
     ```
     http://localhost:3000/weather?city=London
     ```
   - **Response:**
     ```json
     {
       "city": "London",
       "temperature": 15.6,
       "description": "light rain"
     }
     ```

2. **Fetch Weather by Current Location**

   - **Endpoint:** `GET /current-location-weather`
   - **Response:**
     ```json
     {
       "city": "London",
       "temperature": 15.6,
       "description": "light rain"
     }
     ```

   This endpoint uses the IP address of the request to determine the user's location. Make sure the service you use for IP-based location detection (like `ipapi.co`) supports the necessary features.

### Error Handling

- If a required parameter is missing or the request fails, the server will return a JSON object with an error message and a corresponding HTTP status code.
